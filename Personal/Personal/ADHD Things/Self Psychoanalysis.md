# People who are unable to mask upset/ frustrate me
The issue has never been people who are *unable* to mask, it's always been people who mask differently to me. Fitting into the generic image of a "normal" person but without changing their logic and systems of thinking. I suspect that this upsets me as I have spent so much of my energy adjusting the ***way*** I think and how I act rather than how I present physically. I get frustrated when other autistic people mask through appearance and not behaviour. I think deep down the reason behind this is jealousy. 
I think I'm jealous that they: 
- don't need to absorb so much of their energy in adjusting their thinking alongside
- can control their appearance whilst I struggle to. [^1]

[^1]: This is something that I'm still finding difficult to put into words. It's less so that I don't understand the concept of appearance and more that I don't understand how to build my own unique style.
