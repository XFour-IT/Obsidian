 >[!question]- Just overreacting, not concerned
13:34
- Very overwhelming day so far
- Had to go to London, spent the first half of the day worrying and putting off leaving 
- Travel to London is stressful
	- Heat
	- Children talking at a normal volume (feels much louder than it is)
	- Whistling 
	- I can *feel* loud sudden noises
- Unclear if overwhelmed due to med side effect or just worrying as I haven't been to London on meds yet
- Feels like meds have unmasked a lot of the negative side of my autism
	- Unclear if this is caused by meds or placebo from when I was researching feeling overwhelmed when I initially upped my dose
- Also possible that I am experiencing withdrawal effects from reducing mirtazapine dose (Went from 30mg to 15mg on 06/05/2024)
- Ideally want to buy ear defenders and sunflower lanyard in London
14:05
- Actually arrived in Paddington 
- Much quieter than during the week. Feeling infinitely more relaxed than expected. Noise cancelling AirPods helping massively 
- Head is all over the place today. If every day was like today then meds would not be worth it.
Reflection
- Scared of the unknown
