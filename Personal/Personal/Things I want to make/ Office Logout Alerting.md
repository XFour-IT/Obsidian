# Brain Dump
- It's really fucking annoying when office randomly redirects you to the logout page and you've got to login again
- Either
	- Make it incredibly, unequivically obvious that it is the logout page
	- Or, organise some sort of fix where it takes you back to where you actually wanted to be
		- Can't do it that way as you'll never be able to logout
		- Possibly a way to track if logout was clicked but feels too invasive
		- Maybe something in the URL?
