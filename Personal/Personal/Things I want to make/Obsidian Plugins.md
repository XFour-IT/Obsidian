# Better Numbering
- Plugin that does auto-numbering GitHub Style
	- Toggle whether lists are auto-numbered either by
		- Flag that's auto-hidden at the text-level (maybe code block)
		- Tag at page level
		- Can do both?
- Numeric list when at top-level
- When moved under another heading, convert to bullet point
- Can fit my sole requirements at first
- If I want to publish, needs to be configurable
# Checkbox anywhere
- Checkboxes you can put anywhere
