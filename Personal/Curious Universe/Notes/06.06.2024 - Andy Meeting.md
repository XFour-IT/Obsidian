# Email to Andy at end of day 
- Financial year cannot be updated to 24/25. It can be configured to use start or end but not both. 
- I've set the financial year to use the start date (e.g. FY24 for 24/25) and I've setup the goals again for the new format. 
- A.D. is genuinely referring to the era of the date. Because for some unknown reason, D365 supports BC financial years.
