Due to the migration from XFour to VisiMedia, the exact due dates are unclear for the TFT M365 licensing. This may cause issues if TFT requests to cancel the license mid-billing period. 
# Key Dates
1st direct debit payment: 21/07/2023

GMCirrus start date: 31/05/2023
WHMCS invoice dates: 18/07/2023 - 17/07/2024 (Was initially November but manually amended as system was not implemented until a few months after payment. Payment was received for the invoice on the 21st July 2023)

ALSO start dates: 25/05/2024 - Renews annually on 25/05
# Possible Resolutions
1. Set subscription to monthly commitment but this will cut profit margins. **THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE NEXT 7 DAYS.** 
If we want to continue ordering annually, it's imperative that the service renews on the 25/05 in WHMCS so that we cannot be stuck paying for 6 months of license after cancellation. 
2. Update due date in WHMCS to 24/05/2025. Manually raise next invoice from 18/07/2024 to 24/05/2025. Yas pays reduced amount this year and pays at correct date next year. 
3. Cancel the current service, apply pro-rata credit, raise new order for correct due dates. Apply credit to new bill. 
These will all require some customer service handholding. I'd be interested to hear your ideas.
