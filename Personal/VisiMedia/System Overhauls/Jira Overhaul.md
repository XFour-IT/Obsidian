# Customer Service Portal
- [x] Link confluence KB?
1. [ ] Setup email signatures
2. [ ] Why are KB templates coming through in all caps? 
- [ ] KB on home page rather than just as suggested articles on ticket creation
- [ ] Setup [workflow](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Service-Management/reopening-a-resolved-ticket/qaq-p/1150504) to reopen resolved tickets when an email response is received
- [ ] Setup workflow to create a new ticket if a response is received to a closed ticket
- [ ] Change SUP- prefix to CS-
- [ ] Update email templates
## New User Request
- [ ] Move to new category
- [ ] Check form; why is there "Email confirmation to" and "Email Address"? 
- [ ] Can we put some headings in to make it a bit clearer? 
### UX Improvements
- Do you know which licenses this user requires? 
- Split Licenses and billing frequency(?)
## New License Request
Not sure if this would be possible without an up to date list of users in Jira. We could potentially create an API link. 
I don't know *how* we'd store the users in Jira without making them their own Jira accounts. 
Should end-users have their own Jira accounts? 
Customers need to be able to turn this off. 
# Internal IT Portal
