I will be on annual leave from the 27th May to the 4th June (inclusive). I will be on site with Selwood on the 5th June, so the first day that I will be back and able to deal with internal VM matters is the 6th June. 
# Actions
- We are awaiting a reply from Yas on [SUP-136](https://visi.atlassian.net/jira/servicedesk/projects/SUP/queues/custom/43/SUP-136)
- I have migrated Yas' & Kathy's licenses to ALSO. There will be a period of 2 days where we are double charged for this the total cost of the double charging is ~£4, of which £3 is KTW. 
- I have sent a separate email relating to KTW licenses. 
- I have sent a separate email regarding TFT billing date issues. **This needs urgent attention.**
# FYI
- Glass Co, TFT, XFour & KTW licenses are now procured through ALSO. 
- As requested in [SUP-136](https://visi.atlassian.net/jira/servicedesk/projects/SUP/queues/custom/43/SUP-136), one of Yas' licenses has been cancelled. (M365 Business Basic)
