- Small risk that people will mistakenly create erroneous cases if they can access the other case types
	- The risk is increased if RedKite update solutions or implement a new button to allow users to create a case
- Biggest risk is that we will end up with the same issue which we have at the moment. 
	- Uncontrolled components in all live environments. 
	- We don't know when this is going to trip us up
	- Could delay future deployments
	- Risk that the environments don't align
		- Increases development time investigating these issues
		- Wastes test time raising these bugs
